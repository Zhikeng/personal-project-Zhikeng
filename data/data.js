        comment: "Pay rates are not increasing with the increasing cost of renting, seems to be the biggest problem for people. Minimum wage has not increased in decades on the federal level (7.25$/hr), in MA the minimum hourly pay is 15$, but that is still not enough to live on for most people, or at least not enough to live alone. Especially for the many people who have a lot of debt from student loans. Buying a property (house) is also too expensive for many people due to inflated housing costs and competition, where most properties are getting offers way above asking price even."
